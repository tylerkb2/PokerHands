# PokerHandsKata

A fun excercise writing poker hands in Typescript. 

I built a very quick Angular UI component to provide a simple display showing which hand each player has, and who has won. Behind the scenes both hand types are determined (ie. Straight, Flush.. etc) and each hand is also given a score. This score is mainly used in the case of a tie-breaker situation.

## Run

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
